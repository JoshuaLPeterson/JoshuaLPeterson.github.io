### Theme
I am building my portfolio on top of this super awesome HTML theme [Prologue](html5up.net) by [@n33co](twitter.com/n33co) though most of the customizations are my own.

### Font Icons and Typography
I am using [fontawesome](fontawesome.io) for the font icons and **Lato** / **Merriweather** for the typefaces for headings &amp; content respectively. The fonts are served via Google Fonts.

### Process
This is build on my **Macbook Pro 13**, using **Sublime Text 2** as a code editor and **blackboard** as the color scheme.
