### While I got started

ownCloud has a come a long way in the past couple of years. I remember starting to contribute to ownCloud by sending a very small design fix to its Contacts app while I was trying to pick up HTML and CSS. I guess it was ownCloud 5 that time and now the 7th version of the software released some time back.

### How's this ownCloud different?

1. The most significant change you will see in the current design is that the *white space*. There is well, plenty of that as we don't use the application navigation anymore. Instead, we have the list of all applications in a dropdown on the top left. The navigation also allows the users to add new applications. This makes the new design very minimal and as I put in **content specific**.

2. Another change you can find in the new release is the left sidebar for the files and various other core applications. The user can *very* easily switch between
	- All files
	- Files shared with you
	- Files shared with others
	- Files shared with a link
	- Deleted Files

3. Another big change is, ownCloud web project 7 is now responsive(screens below 768px) as well adaptive. The left sidebar uses snap.js which allows a user to drag out/in the sidebar for mobile screens.

4. The left navigation is now consistent with various applications throughout ownCloud and is a part of core. So, designers getting started with ownCloud can pick up the basic styling very fast.

5. ownCloud 7 comes with a new version of user management which makes it very simple for administrating users as there is a groupwise filter implemented on the left sidebar. There is also search input which allows you to quickly search through the users by their display name / groupwise / email etc.
