###Updates

Earlier this month, I spent majority of my time on customizing the angulardatepicker and the calendar list, which works perfectly now.

Post that we started working on displaying events on the angular fullcalendar used which took a lot of time, Skype calls with Bernhard (my ex mentor and Notes App author) but we finally just got it right.

Realizing the need to implement and add and remove event source made my scrap off the routing behavior. It currently works for me, but I still have to cover it for all use cases.

On another note, the community is getting together at TU Berlin from August 26th to August 31st for writing code and ofcourse sharing beer. If you are around, please do come. I bet we will be having some really amazing talks and workshops for newbies or experienced ownClouders alike.
[Here](http://owncloud.org/conf/), you can find more details to the conference.
