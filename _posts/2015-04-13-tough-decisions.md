As I am graduating this year, the usual question of choosing betwwen higher education and job had to come up, from my family and my friends here. Morever, I had applied to Sweden for a **MS** in **Human Computer Interaction**, in **KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm** which ranks in the top Europan universities. I had 0 hopes of cracking it considering a different background and low Grade Point Average, but somehow I managed to crack it. I don't know how it happened, but certainly makes me think, I, at least did something in past 3 years.

## Moving On
It's tough to say, but I am not taking an admit as of now. I might, as well, go for it in future, but not now. I have my own set of personal / financial reasons accompanied by my will to step in the industry first. I am 22 right now, so an MS can most certainly wait.

## Say hello to BrowserStack
In other news, I am joining **[BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com)**, as an Interaction Designer later next month and start a new (*and more returning*) journey of my life. I have been in love with Mumbai &amp; I am glad that I am not moving away from it.
BrowserStack has an extremely long list of clients that varying from **GitHub**, **jQuery**, **Microsoft** to **Bose**, **MIT**, **RBS** and *many more*.

I think, this will give me a lot of exposure as well as a steep learning curve. This way I can also give back to the long list of developers and designers who helped me pick up both code and design.

## Major Credits
I had promised myself to thank a lot of people who play a pivotal role in my life and have been instrumental in the decisions I took:

### My folks at ownCloud

1. [Alessandro Cosentino](http://algorithmsforthekitchen.com/blog/): For the Statement of Purpose and being one of the most humble seniors I have met.
2. [Jan Christoph Borchardt](http://jancborchardt.net): My first fling with interaction design happened when I used to accompany Jan while bug fixing ownCloud.
3. [Bernhard Posselt](http:://github.com/raydiation): My first Summer of Code Mentor &amp; the guy who helped me pick up programming.
4. [Georg Ehrke](http:://github.com/georgehrke): The best colaborator so far, we still work together, &amp; would continue to work together on the ownCloud Calendar.
5. [Frank Karlitschek](http://karlitschek.de): For keeping the ownCloud community growing which still keeps me hooked up on the project.

### My Indian friends &amp; colleagues
1. [Aniket Pant](http:://github.com/aniketpant): I don't think I would have picked up any interest towards the web if he was not a part of my friend circle. My initial fling with front-end development is a result of me sitting in his room.
2. **Akshay Vikas**, **Upasana Maheshwari** for taking time out for my Statement of Purpose.
3. **Shreya Pandit**: For introducing me to KDE and open source software.
4. [Rasagy Sharma](http://www.rasagy.in): For sticking around. :D


## Journey Continues
Considering my thesis or my job, I still would continue to contribute to open source software in my free time.

Also, pardon me, if I miss someone. I have long list of people to thank, so I will switch to emails for that matter.
