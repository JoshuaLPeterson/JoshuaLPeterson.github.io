I have been building for the web since quite a while. During this time, I have mostly juggled the role of an interaction / UI designer and a front-end developer. As a developer, I can expect the following out from a designer I am working with :-

1. Some very basic terminal commands. Nothing really badass with the terminal, but I do expect a designer to know how switch between folders / files via the terminal. Maintain a cheat-sheet. This surely helps.
2. A rough idea about what is Software Version Control, or as the product designer sitting right next to me says ‘using Git’. Point 1 and 2 compliment each other if the designer uses terminal to do this. This is important if you want to revert / save the changes he/she has made.
3. An ability to use Stack-Overflow and Google effectively. This will solve all the problems and you don’t have to ping a developer about setting up XAMPP or starting a rails server.
4. Pixel Perfection is important: agreed, but 20px is much more readable than 19px or 21px. Prefer using multiples of 5 while you align the content.
5. Ask someone around, or use Google before starting to use a new technology which affects the code. In other words,

>If you want the developers of your team to love you, don’t use stuff like DreamWeaver, it sucks.
