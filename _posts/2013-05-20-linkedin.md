## Position

### UI Developer Intern

## Projects
1. As an initial project, I designed and developed a WordPress theme for [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net), now a LinkedIn company. The new theme SlideShare was developed over [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/), a WordPress starter theme by [Eddie Machado](http://themble.com/).

2. I majorly helped refactoring the SlideShare internal tools that were used by the business development team to coordinate with both enterprise and free users.
