A long wait for the results for Google Summer of Code 2014 comes to an end with some good news. My project idea of Developing the Calendar Application front-end using angularJS for ownCloud has been accepted. 

[Here](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/raghunayyar/5659847773126656) is the link to the proposal.

I will be spending my summers with [Georg Ehrke](https://github.com/georgehrke) as my mentor and the super awesome [ownCloud community](https://owncloud.org) under the umbrella of openSUSE.

Both Georg and me can be found pushing code on the [rework](https://github.com/owncloud/calendar/tree/rework) branch on the [Calendar](https://github.com/owncloud/calendar) Application. So, we hope to see you there and stay tuned for more updates.
