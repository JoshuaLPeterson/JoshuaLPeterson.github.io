First of all, apologies for not being very regular with the blogging. As my majors and my on campus life at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) get over, the community bonding period also gets over today for the Google Summer of Code project.

Since, I am already familier with the community, both me and Georg wasted no time in getting things started.

So yes, like most of the "newer" ownCloud applications like News and Notes app. I am writing the front-end on angularJS and using GruntJS as the JavaScript task runner. Currently, I am almost done making the UI for the Calendar sidebar which involved my first experience with using the RESTful services the appframework generates.

Georg has already very well documented the [JSON Api](https://github.com/owncloud/calendar/wiki/Draft:-JSON-API-Doc) and the [Timezone API](https://github.com/owncloud/calendar/wiki/Draft:-JSON-Timezone-API) making my job simpler.

Since, this is the first time I am working on an RESTful API, I strongly referred to the [Notes Application](https://github.com/owncloud/notes) by Bernhard (Raydiation on #ownCloud-dev on IRC).

Now, I will be travelling home for 2 and a half months of vacations completely dedicated to the ownCloud Project. Let's see how the coding period goes.
