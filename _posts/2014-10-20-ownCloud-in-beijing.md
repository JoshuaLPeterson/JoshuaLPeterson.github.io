I am currently in my flight back to India and recovering from a super awesome first edition of openSUSE Asia Summit, 2014 which was held in Beijing, China. This was one of the biggest opensource conferences I have attended with people from India, China, Taiwan, Japan, Netherlands, Germany and many other countries.

I was here bearing the ownCloud Community flag and I took a talk on **Building for the ownCloud Project** and a workshop on **How to build your first ownCloud app!**. Both of them went pretty well.

Major credit goes to the 50+ amazing volunteers who worked day and night to organise and Beihang University for being a great host. I also got to know several ownCloud Community guys have also been / are associated with the openSUSE Community which is really cool.

I have visited some good number of cities, both nationally and internationally but Beijing is probably one of the most **different** (*in a very good way*) cities I have been to. The culture and the food is mind blowing. I got to taste Chinese cuisine which included trying more than 10 different types of meat in 2 dinner meals. This is by far the maximum I have experimented with my stomach and it turned out to be succesful.

Before my thesis started, I spent most of my free time contributing to ownCloud but I certainly look forward to contributing to openSUSE in the coming future.

Looking forward to more awesome stuff from the opensource world!

**Edit**
I had forgot to add the slides of my talk. So here you go!
