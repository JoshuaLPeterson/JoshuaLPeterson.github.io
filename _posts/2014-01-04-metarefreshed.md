I am in Bangalore for a couple of days, for attending probably the only conference India has for User Interfaces of the web. I was speaking there on Transitional Interfaces and CSS 3 Animations.

Here are bunch of resources which proved out to be of very high importance.

1. The concept of Transitional Interfaces cant be better explained by anyone but Pasqual D'Silva. [Here](https://medium.com/design-ux/926eb80d64e3) is an awesome blogpost by him.
2. Another great on the topic [Designing User Interfaces for Your Mother](https://medium.com/design-ux/dd45ec50f7b0â€Ž).
3. A Brilliant Paper on [Relating Cartoons with User Interfaces]( http://selflanguage.org/_static/published/animation.pdf).
4. [Use your Interfaces](http://useyourinterface.com/)  for Inspiration while designing Interfaces.
5. [12 basic Principles on Animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation) by Disney.
6. Consider reading about the Spotify Redesign. It's up on behance and [here](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Spotify-Redesign/7592981) is the link.
7. And ofcourse, [CodePen](http://codepen.io), as one of the best places to get started.

I guess these resources might just be enough to get you started on Animations.
