**It's been almost a week I have been thinking about this and finally I have decided to give up on most of the services Google provides. Following are some of them:-**

**GMail and Hangouts**:- When I had started taking Interaction Design a bit seriously, GMail seemed a bit *flawed* to me in terms of user interactions. I strongly believe its way to **overfeatured**. Google is doing a great job of providing a lot of services but in order to do that, it is losing the basic purpose which is to send and receive emails. There is too much information overload on the GMail home screen, there are Hangouts by the side and commercials on top & bottom based on my search history. More time Google has spent on redesigning it's interface is **hardly** reflected as soon as you reach the settings. I am seeing the same UI since the past at least 3 redesigns GMail did to it's home page.
Now lets switch to the experience, there are roughly 11 tabs I see in the settings each of which has almost 10-20 input fields, 5-10 radio buttons and other *cool* stuff. I mean what is the point of all those settings when I will have to *Google* the process to follow to make a small change. Call me an Apple fanboy, but I love it when Apple doesnt ship manuals with its products because they keep things minimal & you just don't feel difficulty finding what you need. Pardon me if I am wrong.

> I am sorry Google, but I dont need your 5 - 10 colorful themes or some more fancy custom layouting for the GMail homepage. All I need is a better **email** client.

**Android**:- I am not sure that is it happening anywhere in the very near future but the next phone I buy will definitely not be an Android device. Though, the Mail App Google ships with the Android has IMAP/POP support but the gut feeling says my data is still monitored. Very similar goes for other applications say News and Weather which is currently showing me more and more bollywood crap since I was following, say, [Deepika Padukone tiff with TOI](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/bollywood-actress-deepika-padukone-cleavage-show-tweet-provokes-anger-online-9735547.html) in the past 24 hours which makes me miss out on more important stuff. Somehow, my previous 24 hour history on News dominated what I usually search there.
I might switch to Firefox OS or iOS in the future, if I have enough money. I feel more secure about my data there. Till then, I am on my Nexus 7. Sadly.

**Calendar**:- I have been working on a [Calendar Application](https://github.com/owncloud/calendar/pull/521) myself since the past 3 months and I have pretty much used Google Calendar & Calendar for Mac. Calendar(iOS/Mac) was one of the best improvements Apple did with iOS 7 & Mavericks especially in terms of UI. Let's see how our calendar application stands in front of it.

**Google Plus**:- I have anyway not used it much but I have been daily marking some notifications about someone adding me to their circles. I find G+, Google's playground for Usability testing as there was a point every week or 2 it had a new design. Not enough google employees use it, eh?

There are some things that I don't think I will give up, mainly Youtube, Maps & ofcourse Chrome mainly there are no great alternatives to them yet. Chrome has a pretty sucky font rendering engine as compared to Firefox but Chrome DevTools are a pleasure to use.

Apart from Google, I have also decided to give up on **Dropbox** as well. I have already disabled syncing my external data on their servers. I bet you guessed it right, an ownCloud instance is comming soon. I am also in touch with [BigRock](http://bigrock.in/) folks from whom I brought my domain & are helping me set up a custom sef hosted email id. My GMail Email address will be disabled right after.
