So, Google Summer of Code 2014 is finally over and yes, I cleared it with Georg Ehrke as my super awesome mentor. He is writing the Calendar backend since quite some time now and I started with the front-end with the summer of code project.

We are currently at TU Berlin, where the community is busy interacting with the folks we know by the IRC nicks and writing some beautiful code.

Things we pushed:

1. A fullcalendar running on angularJS.
2. Creating, Editing and Updating Calendars and Subscriptions.
3. Displaying the events daywise, weekly and monthly.
4. Porting jQuery Modal to angularJS. (This gave me a ridiculously tough time)
5. A very basic Events Editor with support for
	- Attendees
	- Reminders

Things I expect to get over by the end of the ownCloud Developer Conference.

1. Calendar Sharing.
2. Optimising / Cleaning Up the mess I created at a couple of places.
3. JavaScript tests, may be.

So, looking forward to an amazing week here.

**PS**: A big thanks to Akriti Gupta, who helped me out with accomodation for a day! :D
