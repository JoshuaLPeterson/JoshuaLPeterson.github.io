###GSoC W-12 Updates

1. The week began with reducing the requests to the server and using the html5 attributes for populating the Calendar settings.
2. We have the new attendee UI finally working in the events editor. Though, it needs some CSS love that me and Georg will give in the coming ownCloud meetup.

###Future

1. Adding support for reminders in the UI. (I want this done before the hard pencils down stage.)
2. Calendar Sharing.

### New Blog

1. A free Saturday and I have the new design on my blog ready. It's based on Jekyll, uses the awesome Font Awesome for the icons and uses *Open Sans* and *Bree Serif* for the typefaces.

**You can find the source code of my blog on [Github](https://github.com/beingminimal/beingminimal.github.io). You can use it for inspiration. Do drop me a mail if something good comes out of it. I will raise a toast from here.**

### IDC, IIT Bombay

I finally have a hostel in IIT-B and its livable. Expecting to make the most of my time now.
