First of all, I am really sorry for being lazy on the blog. I recently shifted to Mumbai as my new semester started at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am working as a Visiting Researcher / Thesis fellow at their Design School (Industrial Design Centre).

Since, I have not yet been given accomadation, I am doing up and down from Dadar, where I am putting up with my really awesome doughnut lover 6 year old brother.

Coming to the GSoC Calendar, there are a hell lot of updates to be shared. I am liking how it is shaping up with Georg and me almost writing code daily, apart from when we have our exams and other such stuff.

1. We could finally integrate angularJS and jQuery UI in a very clean way.
2. Started work on the new new events editor UI.
3. Users can now import their text/calendar mimetype files into the ownCloud calendar.
4. Support for Subscriptions.
5. Support for event resizing and drag and drop of the events in the fullcalendar.
6. The changes made to the calendar are based on the API response now. Every restangular call gets  error handling support.

###On my list:
Support for Attendees and repeating events.
