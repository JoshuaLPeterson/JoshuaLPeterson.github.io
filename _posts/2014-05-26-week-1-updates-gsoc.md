Week 1 with the Calendar Application went pretty eventful.

After starting out with fixing the angular routes, me and Georg decided to bring in numerical IDs for the requests which sort of made me alter some of my code though things are bang on now.

I also added a static fullcalendar just to check how are things working. 
Apart from this, a dedicated colorpicker directive with some design customizations is also added.

This is how the calendar application looks as of now.

Things you can expect to come this week :-
1. CRUDS on the Calendar List working
2. Some basic stuff with the event handling on the Full Calendar.

On the experience part, I might end the week with
1. A sexier datepicker.
2. some ng-animate additions on the UI, especially the Calendar list.
